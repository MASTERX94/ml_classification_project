# Classification Project: Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing
### Objective: Build a model to classify customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior. This helps businesses create targeted marketing campaigns.

### Why This Project?
- Useful for e-commerce, retail, and banking businesses.  
- Helps in customer retention and personalized marketing.

### Project Steps:
1. Data Collection
Use datasets like:
Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
E-commerce Customer Data

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical data (e.g., gender, region) into numerical form.
Scale numerical features (e.g., annual income, spending score).

3. Feature Engineering
Create new features like "Average Purchase Value" or "Loyalty Score."
Use clustering (K-Means) to define segments.

4. Model Selection (No Deep Learning Needed)
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

5. Model Evaluation
Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Check confusion matrix for misclassification insights.

6. Deployment
Deploy using Flask/FastAPI.
Build a simple web dashboard (Streamlit) where businesses can input customer details and get a segment prediction.
